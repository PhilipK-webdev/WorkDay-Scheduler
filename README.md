# Introduction: Work Day-Scheduler

Our home assignment Work Day-Scheduler is all about to build a web page with live time using moment.js.
The web page helps to write notes during the day on each day. At the end of the day the user can delete all the events that he has on the past day and setting the Scheduler to be ready for new day. 


## User Story

```

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
